# Wormhole Workshop Starter Pack

Wormhole connects blockchains with a generic message-passing protocol to facilitate interoperability between ecosystems. Developers are able to leverage the protocol to send arbitrary data cross-chain including tokens, NFTs, oracle data, governance decisions and more.

In the Wormhole Workshop from 7 - 8pm on Saturday in room Nobhill AB, we will build a cross-chain decentralized application (xApp) with live coding.
