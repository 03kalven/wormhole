== btc -> non-btc direction (btc outbound)

# User goes to magic website to generate a mapping between wormhole-address and btc address
## When the user registers this mapping, give them the option of allocating a fee so that this txn can be relayed automatically?
## mapping is stored somewhere in wormchain
# Wormchain publishes an event that is observed by the guardian to update its map
# User goes to CEX, whitelists the new address, and sends btc
# Guardian observes the txn,
## Makes a call onto wormchain to allocate a sequence number for this txn (which allocates space for every txn to hold this mapping)
## Generates a observation/vaa
# User goes back to magic website, enters the destination btc address.. and retrieves vaa
# User goes to destination chain and redeems vaa
